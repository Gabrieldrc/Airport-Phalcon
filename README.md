# Airport-Phalcon

an application made with the phalcon framework.

This is a page that allows you to register flights and airplanes, and to be able to assign them to have a 
registry and control of all the movements of the airport.

Soon, aircraft departure and arrival times will be added to allow simulations.
In addition, the objects 'Clients' and 'Personal' will be added along with the entire process of buying and 
selling tickets, boarding, etc.
